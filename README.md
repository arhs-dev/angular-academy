# Exercises

1. Create An ACTORS LIST
* When clicking on a movie from the movies list, call the server to get the actors list.
* Create a caching interceptor that will check if data are already in cache and get them from there, or if there are not do the actual request.
* Use the same approach with the movies list example with the Module that creates fake entities instead of calling the server. For example create an entity that has actors list and id
* Show the list of actors under movies

2. Create A Registration FORM
* Create a registration form with name, lastname, username, password that on submit will send all the fields to the server.
* On Success you can hide the form and show a success message.
